<b>Worms</b>—unlike viruses, they don’t attack the host, being self-contained programs that propagate across networks and computers. Worms are often installed through email attachments, sending a copy of themselves to every contact in the infected computer email list. They are commonly used to overload an email server and achieve a denial-of-service attack.

<h1><b>Top 5 Types of Computer Worms</b></h1>
<p>Computer worms are classified based on the way they are distributed in the systems. Some are explained below.</p>
<ol>
<h2><li><b>Email Worms</li></b></h2>

The email box is used as a client by the worm. The mail has infected link or attachment which once opened downloads the worm. This worm searches the email contacts of the infected system and sends links so that those systems are also destroyed. These worms have double extensions like mp4 or video extensions so that the user believes it to be media extensions. These worms do not have a downloadable link but a short link to open the same. The link is clicked and the worm is downloaded, it either deletes the data or modifies the same and the network is destroyed. An example of an email worm is ILOVEYOU worm which infected computers in 2000.
<br>
<h2><li><b>Internet Worms</li></h2></b>
Internet is used as a medium to search other machines vulnerable and affect them. Those systems where the antiviruses are not installed are affected easily with these worms. Once the machines are located they are infected and the same process is started all over again in those systems. This is used to check the recent updates and security measures if the system hasn’t installed any. The worm spreads through the internet or local area network connections.
<br>
<h2><li><b>File-Sharing Network Worms</li></h2></b>
When a file from an unknown source is downloaded, the file may have worm which locates a shared folder and destroys other files. When another system downloads file from the same network, the worm locates that system as well and is replicated. And the process is repeated for all the systems in the network. These worms are media or other extensions and hence users can easily download the same thinking that they are an extension of the files. A worm ‘Phatbot’ infected computers in 2004 through sharing files. This worm has stolen personal information such as credit card details and destroyed many systems on an unprecedented scale.
<br>
<h2><li><b>Instant Message and Chat Room Worms</li></h2></b>
These worms work as email worms as the contacts from chat rooms are taken and messages are sent to those contacts. Once the contact accepts the invitation and opens the message or link, the system is infected. The worms have either links to open websites or attachments to download. These worms are not as effective as other worms. Users can destroy these worms by changing the password and deleting the messages.
